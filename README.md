This project provides an easy to use ML based heart disease pre-screening assistant app for medical workers with minimal to no technical/computational expertise. The app offers dynamic training options to train multiple ML models based on the medical institutions requirements with options for exploratory analysis, feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. By default, the models are trained on the UCI heart disease dataset (kaggle) but every medical institution can use their own patient data to avoid biases or model drif caused due to the particular demographics of the UCI dataset.
